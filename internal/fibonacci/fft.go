// mulFFT performs the multiplication of two *big.Int instances, x and y.
// It uses an algorithm based on the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), and returns
// the result as a new *big.Int. This method is particularly efficient for
// multiplying very large numbers, typically offering a time complexity of
// O(N log N), where N is the number of bits in the operands. It serves as a
// high-performance alternative to the standard big.Int.Mul method for numbers
// exceeding a certain size threshold.
//
// Parameters:
//   - x: The first operand.
//   - y: The second operand.
//
// Returns:
//   - *big.Int: The product of x and y.
func mulFFT(x, y *big.Int) *big.Int {
